# Product-Management-Application
A python application for the selling and management of products. Created for a university project.
The application allows for the purchasing of items from all stores, as well as the management of different stores depending on the affiliation of the manager that is logged in.
The following files were created/supplied by my teachers, for which I take no credit:
  - Supplier
  - Suppliers
  - User
  - Users
  - Utils
  - Organisation
  - Cart
  - Product
  - Products
  - image

All other files were created solely by myself.
